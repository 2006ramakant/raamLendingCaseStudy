## General Information

### Project Information

> The project is a data science project that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

### Project Background

>Lending club is the largest peer-to-peer marketplace connecting borrowers with lenders. Borrowers apply through an online platform where they are assigned on an internal score. Lenders decide 1) whether to lend and 2) the terms of the loan such as interest rate, monthly installment, tenure etc..

### Project Statement

> Find the driving factors which lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company.

## Conclusions

- Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of defaulting and avoiding Credit Loss:
  1. DTI
  2. Grades
  3. Verification Status
  4. Annual income
  5. Pub_rec_bankruptcies
- Other considerations for 'defaults' :
  1. Borrowers should not be from large urban cities like California, New York, Texas, Florida.
  2. Borrowers having annual income less than 70k are risky.
  3. Borrowers having Public recorded bankruptcy should be avoided.
  4. Borrowers with High DTI are risky.
  5. Burrowers with very high Debt to Income value.
  6. Borrowers with working experience more than 10 years are risky.
